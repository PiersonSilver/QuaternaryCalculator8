## What was Discussed
We went over more specifics on who will do what and the progress that was made the night before.
Also worked on getting the Github repository to work for everyone

## How to run it
After you have cloned or downloaded it, you want to do the following things
1. make sure you have a jdk in version 21. The Amazon Correto Version should work.
2. After that, you should run the main class which should open up the calculator.
