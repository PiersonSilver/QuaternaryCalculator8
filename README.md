# Quaternary Calculator

A calculator that allows for simple calculations to be done using quaternary numbers.
The calculator also allows for conversion between the quaternary and decimal values of each input. 

## Run Instructions
To use the calculator after you have cloned or downloaded the project, do the following:
1. Ensure that you are running on Java version 20 or higher (The project was built using openJDK 21, but has been tested to work with java 20)
2. Run the main class. This will open the calculator.
3. When using the calculator, the 'root' and 'sqr' functions will calculate the inputted number on click, and the '+', '-', '*', and '/' functions will calculate
upon inputting your second number and clicking '='. The 'dec'/'quat' button will convert to and from quaternary on click.
